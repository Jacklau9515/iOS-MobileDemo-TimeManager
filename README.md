# iOS-MobileDemo-TimeManager

## Introduction
A mobile application, called “Time Manager” which aims to help university students in their studies, and hopefully to help them become organized in their lives. “Time Manager” comprises four functional pages: a home page that navigates users; a page that allows users to plan and prioritize academic activities; a page that enables users to view activities and record actions; and a page that embeds the TMQ (Time Management Questionnaire). 

### Home Screen
A main screen providing the name of your application and buttons that link to the other functionality of this application, including background images, the user’s time management score based on the TMQ questionnaire, upcoming task deadlines.

o Answers should be based on the following 5-point Likert scale (1=Never, 2=Infrequently, 3=Sometimes, 4=Frequently, and 5=Always). The application should also calculate a final TMQ score for the user.
